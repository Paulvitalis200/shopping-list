// 1. Create a table of your shopping list containing the three items in the list with three columns. Description, Category and Amount
// 2. Calculate the total amount using javascript's "reduce" method. Read up on it from google
// Check the ReadMe file on Github of this project to see how the table should appear.
// Fetch them from the table above and put them into  a html page with javascript.
// Do not use any CSS. Ensure to only use Bootstrap. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/tables/
